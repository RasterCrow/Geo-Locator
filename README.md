## You can play it [here](https://geolocator.rastercrow.me/)

Geoguessr clone made with React and Firebase Real Time Database, Firebase Hosting and Google Maps API.

# Info

If you sometimes feel like playing Geoguessr with your friends, but don't want to pay the monthly fee, Geo Locator can help you.

It's still WIP , still have some work to do on perfomance improvements, but it works and for my use it's ok as it is.

You can now play it without hosting it [here](https://geolocator.rastercrow.me/). If you need some help visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/RasterCrow/Geo-Locator/wiki).

You can also add your own locations by going to _src/utilities/locations.json_ and add your Latitude and Longitude of the the location you want to add to the correct array (based on the ids from gamemodes.json in the same directory).
